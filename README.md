Question 1 graphs a histogram that displays the total number of items
in each transaction with the total number of these transactions in
the Groceries dataset.

Question 2 determines the total number of frequent itemsets, closed
frequent itemsets, and maximal frequent itemsets when the minimum
support is 0.001.

Question 3 finds the total number of frequent itemsets, closed frequent
itemsets, and maximal frequent itemsets when the minimum support is 
0.01. The top ten results for the frequent itemsets, closed frequent
itemsets, and maximal frequent itemsets are then displayed.

Question 4 displays the total number of transactions in the dataset 
and the total number of items in the dataset.

Question 5 determines the number of association rules when minimum 
support is 0.01 and minimum confidence is 0.9. It then calculates the
minimum confidence value required so that there will be more than 10
association rules.
